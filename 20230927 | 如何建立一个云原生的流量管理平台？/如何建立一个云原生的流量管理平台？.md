随着云计算和云原生技术的发展，传统的负载均衡系统已经无法满足现代应用和云原生场景的需求。需要建立一种新一代的云原生流量管理平台。 本演讲首先将分析现代应用和云原生对负载均衡带来的新问题，例如动态的扩缩容，提供多租户管理能力，支持应用的敏捷发布，大规模应用层路由以及多个集群之间的快速准确的流量调度。 随后，将分析负载均衡领域的一些变化，并从编程语言的角度分析第七层负载均衡的生态景观。 最后，以BFE开源项目为例，说明如何建立一个云原生流量管理平台。 
With the development of cloud computing and cloud native technology, traditional load balancing systems are no longer able to meet the needs of modern applications and cloud native scenarios. A new generation of cloud native traffic management platform needs to be established. This speech will first analyze the new issues brought by modern applications and cloud native to load balancing, such as dynamic scaling up and down, to provide multi-tenant management capabilities, to support the agile release of applications, large-scale application layer routing and fast and accurate traffic scheduling between multiple clusters. Subsequently, some changes in the field of load balancing are analyzed. And the ecological landscape of layer-7 load balancing is analyzed from the perspective of programming languages. Finally, the BFE open source project is taken as an example to illustrate how to establish a cloud native traffic management platform.
