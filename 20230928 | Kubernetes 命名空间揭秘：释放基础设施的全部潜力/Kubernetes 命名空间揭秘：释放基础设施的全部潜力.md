每个现代开发平台都被设计或渴望成为多租户。满足这一基本要求对于任何平台来说都是至关重要的，以便有效扩展、为众多客户提供服务，并提供一种具有成本效益的解决方案。 在Adobe，Victor和Adrian正在构建和运行一个跨云、多租户的Kubernetes平台，帮助产品团队以高速度和成本效益的生态系统构建和运行其服务。使用或开发了一套开源工具和流程，如Cilium、Envoy、Kata Containers、Open Policy Agent、K8s-Shredder等。 他们将展示他们五年的旅程，运行一个跨云、多租户平台，旨在托管各种应用程序，从简单的应用到高度先进的人工智能应用。讨论将涵盖平台的指导理念、他们遇到的挑战以及他们在成功实现速度和可靠性之间的平衡时所学到的教训。 
Every modern developer platform is designed or aspires to be multi-tenant. It is essential for any platform to meet this fundamental requirement in order to scale effectively, serve numerous customers, and provide a cost-effective solution. At Adobe, Victor and Adrian are working on building and running a cross-cloud, multi-tenant Kubernetes platform that helps product teams to build and run their services with high velocity and in a cost-effective ecosystem. A set of open-source tools and processes were used or developed like Cilium, Envoy, Kata Containers, Open Policy Agent, K8s-Shredder and friends. They will present their five-year journey of running a cross-cloud, multi-tenant platform designed to host a wide range of applications, from simple ones to highly advanced AI ones. The discussion will encompass the platform's guiding philosophies, the challenges they encountered, and the lessons they learned while successfully achieved the balance between velocity and reliability.
