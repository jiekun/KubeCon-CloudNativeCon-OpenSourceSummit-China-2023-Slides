在当今全球经济中，了解不同文化背景对新技术的采用和认知的影响至关重要。云原生技术为企业提供了创新、可扩展性和成本降低等重要优势。然而，这些技术的商业价值在不同文化和地区可能存在差异。 文化对风险和创新的态度影响了云原生技术的采用。有些文化可能更注重稳定性和可预测性，而不是创新和敏捷性。监管环境、市场条件和文化对技术和创新的态度等因素都会影响长期战略方向。 在本次演讲中，我们将讨论如何有效地向具有不同文化背景的利益相关者、高管和投资者传达云原生技术的优势。 
In today's global economy, it's crucial to understand how different cultural contexts impact the adoption and perception of new technologies. Cloud native technology offers significant benefits for businesses, such as innovation, scalability, and cost reduction. However, the business value of these technologies may vary across different cultures and regions. Cultural attitudes towards risk and innovation impact the adoption of cloud native technologies. Some cultures may prioritize stability and predictability over innovation and agility. Factors such as regulatory environments, market conditions, and cultural attitudes towards technology and innovation all affect long term strategic direction. In this talk, we will discuss how to effectively communicate the benefits of cloud native technologies to stakeholders, executives, and investors with different cultural backgrounds.
