Kyverno is a policy engine designed specifically for Kubernetes, allowing for the seamless management of policies through admission control or CI/CD pipelines. To streamline and simplify the testing process for Kyverno, the Kyverno team has developed an isolated test environment called Kyverno Playground. In this session, Shuting will guide you through the process of creating Kyverno policies from scratch. She will demonstrate how to apply these policies to different resource types and configurations using the Kyverno Playground. By the end of the session, you will have gained the knowledge and skills to effortlessly build and test Kyverno policies, all without the need for a Kubernetes cluster.
