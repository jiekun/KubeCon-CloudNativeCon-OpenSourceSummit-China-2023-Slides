在云原生领域，eBPF的热度正在迅速增长，但是要知道从哪里开始或如何跟上进展可能会让人感到害怕。在这次演讲中，比尔将追溯他是如何接触到eBPF的，探索当今云原生领域中一些可用的eBPF应用，并教授其他人如何在eBPF的活动中深入探索而不被咬伤。 刚开始接触eBPF的人将了解到在云原生世界中，eBPF如何实现高效的网络、无需仪器的可观测性、轻松的追踪和实时安全等功能。已经熟悉eBPF的人将获得对eBPF领域的概述，并了解到许多新的和不断扩展的eBPF应用，使他们能够利用其功能而无需深入研究字节码。听众将对云原生中eBPF的热度有所了解，并了解到可能解决他们在网络、可观测性和安全性方面问题的新工具。 
The buzz around eBPF in cloud native is growing quickly but it can be scary to know where to start or how to keep up. In this talk, Bill will trace how he got into eBPF, explore some of the cloud native eBPF applications available today, and teach others how to dive into the hive of activity around eBPF without getting bytten. People just beginning with eBPF will learn how eBPF makes it possible to have efficient networking, observability without instrumentation, effortless tracing, and real-time security (among other things) in a cloud native world. Those already familiar with eBPF will get an overview of the eBPF landscape and learn about many new and expanding eBPF applications that allow them to harness the power without needing to dive into the bytecode. The audience will walk away with an understanding of the buzz around eBPF in cloud native and knowledge of new tools that may solve some of their problems in networking, observability, and security.
