Harbor是一个企业级的开源容器注册表，提供安全性、可扩展性和高可用性，用于存储和管理容器镜像。在本次会议中，我们将讨论Harbor项目的最新更新和增强功能，包括即将发布的最新功能和改进。我们将演示v2.9版本中的新功能“SecurityHub”，该功能以不同级别的全面视图呈现漏洞，并且管理员可以灵活地搜索和报告漏洞信息。与OCI分发规范v1.1的对齐也是一个重要的更新，可以扩展更多的客户端，如notary v2。最后但并非最不重要的是，我们将讨论Harbor性能的改进，例如并行GC和并发推送。 
Harbor is an enterprise-class open-source container registry that provides security, scalability, and high availability for storing and managing container images. In this session, we will discuss the latest updates and enhancements to the Harbor project, including the newest features and improvements in the upcoming release. We will demo the new anchor feature “SecurityHub” in v2.9, which provides a way to present a vulnerability in a holistic view with different levels, and the administrators could search and report the vulnerability information flexibly. The alignment with OCI distribution spec v1.1 is also an important update that can extend more clients such as notary v2. Last but not least, we will talk about the improvement in Harbor's performance, such as parallel GC and concurrent push.
