这个演讲想要谈论一个重要的话题，即在使用CRD扩展Kubernetes时遇到的一些挑战。正如您所知，自定义资源定义（CRDs）是扩展Kubernetes以管理自定义资源的强大方式。然而，当人们第一次开始使用它时，由于对API设计约定的理解不足，他们经常遇到不同的问题。在这个演讲中，我将与您分享一些在使用CRD扩展Kubernetes时需要了解的API设计约定。我们将讨论在设计API时需要牢记的事项，最佳实践以及一些设计标准。通过这个演讲的结束，您将对API设计约定有更深入的了解，并具备成功使用CRD扩展Kubernetes所需的知识。 
This representation would like to talk about an important topic that has been causing some challenges when extending Kubernetes using CRDs. As you may know, Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are a powerful way to extend Kubernetes to manage your custom resources. However, when people start using it for the first time, they often encounter different issues due to a lack of understanding of API design conventions. In this talk, I'll be sharing with you some of the API design conventions that you need to know when using CRD to extend Kubernetes. We will be discussing what you need to keep in mind while designing your API, the best practices, and some of the design standards. By the end of this talk, you'll have gained a deeper understanding of API design conventions and be equipped with the knowledge you need to successfully extend Kubernetes with CRDs.
