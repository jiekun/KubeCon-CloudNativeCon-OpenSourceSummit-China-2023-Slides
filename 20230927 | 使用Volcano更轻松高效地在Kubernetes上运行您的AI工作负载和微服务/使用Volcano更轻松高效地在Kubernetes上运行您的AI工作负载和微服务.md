Volcano是一个云原生的批处理系统，也是CNCF中第一个批处理计算项目。其主要应用场景是在高性能计算（HPC）领域，如大数据、人工智能和基因计算等。 Volcano提供了许多能力，如基于作业的公平共享、优先级、抢占、回收和队列管理能力，以帮助提高批处理工作负载的性能。它已经与大数据、人工智能和HPC计算领域的计算生态系统集成，如spark-operator、fink-operator、kubeflow、Ray和Cromwell。 今年，Volcano取得了很大的成果。许多贡献者正在开发新功能，以优化大规模集群的资源利用率、协同部署、为AIGC提供资源感知调度增强等。目前，已有50多个用户在其生产环境中部署了Volcano。 本次演讲将介绍最新的进展、新功能、用户采用情况、新子项目以及社区的未来。 
Volcano is a cloud native batch system which is also the first batch computing project in CNCF. The major use cases are in the field of high-performance computing (HPC), such as big data, AI, Gene computing. Volcano has been offering lot's of ablities like job based fair-share, priority, preemption, reclaim, queue management abilities to help improving the batch workload performance. It has integrated with computing ecosystem like spark-operator, fink-operator, kubeflow, Ray, Cromwell in big data, AI and HPC computing domains. This year Volcano has achieved great results. And many new features are being developed by contributors to optimizing resource utilization for large-scale clusters, co-location, resource awareness scheduling enhancement for AIGC etc. Currently more than 50 users have deployed Volcano in their production environments. This talk will presents the newest progress, new features, user adoptions, new sub-projects and the future of the community.
