EnvoyProxy是云原生时代的代理之一，也是CNCF下的毕业项目之一。Envoy Gateway是由EnvoyProxy的创始人Matt Klein发起的API网关项目，由Emissary、Contour和其他API网关项目共同维护。 Envoy Gateway作为EnvoyProxy发起的官方API网关项目，是基于EnvoyProxy的南北向API网关的官方实现，大大降低了使用EnvoyProxy的门槛，使用户不必重复“造轮子”来构建EnvoyProxy控制平面，并处理难以理解的复杂xDS协议和EnvoyProxy的配置。Envoy Gateway使用Kubernetes Gateway API作为其配置，可以轻松启动管理南北向流量。 Envoy Gateway在多个社区和积极贡献者的推动下迅速发展。本主题将全面介绍Envoy Gateway以及它为云原生时代的API网关的原因。 
EnvoyProxy is a proxy in the cloud-native era and one of the graduation projects under CNCF. Envoy Gateway is an API gateway project initiated by Matt Klein, the creator of EnvoyProxy, and jointly maintained by Emissary, Contour and other API gateway projects. Envoy Gateway, as the official API Gateway project initiated by EnvoyProxy, is the official implementation of EnvoyProxy-based north-south API Gateway, which greatly reduces the threshold to use EnvoyProxy, so that users do not have to repeatedly "build wheels" to EnvoyProxy control plane, and deal with the difficult to understand the complex xDS protocol and the configuration of EnvoyProxy. Envoy Gateway uses the Kubernetes Gateway API as its configuration, which can easily start to manage north-south traffic. Envoy Gateway is rapidly developing, driven by multiple communities and active contributors. This topic takes you through a comprehensive look at Envoy Gateway and why it is the API gateway for the Cloud-Native era.
