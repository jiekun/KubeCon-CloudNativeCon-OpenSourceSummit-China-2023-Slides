随着服务网格成为服务管理的事实标准，越来越多的企业正在过渡采用服务网格。像Istio这样的服务网格在应用侵入性方面具有很大优势。然而，用户觉得还远远不够令人满意，特别是在边车资源成本和负载均衡方面。 服务网格的未来会是什么样子？负载均衡会是怎样的？服务网格和传统负载均衡器有什么区别？ 在本次会议中，钟虎将带领大家重新思考云原生应用网络的未来。他将讲解能够导致群体行为的最短队列加入（JSQ）算法。然后介绍著名的二选一（Choice-of-2）算法，可以消除群体行为。但这些还不够，还应考虑来自“服务器报告的利用率”的更多因素。服务网格可以实现对现代云原生应用网络的最高效流量调度。 
As service mesh becomes the defacto of service management, more and more enterprises are transiting to adopt service mesh. Service mesh like Istio is with great advantage especially application invasive. However, users feel that is far from satisfactory, especially on sidecar resource costs and load balancing. What's the future of service mesh? What will the load balancing be like? What's the difference between service mesh and traditional load balancer? In this session, Zhonghu will lead you to rethink what is the future of cloud-native application networks like. He will talk about Join-the-Shortest-Queue(JSQ) algorithm which could lead to herd behavior. And then the famous Choice-of-2 algorithm, which could eliminate the herd behavior. But these are not enough, some more factors from the `server-reported utilization` should be considered. service mesh can achieve the most efficient traffic scheduling for modern cloud-native application network.
