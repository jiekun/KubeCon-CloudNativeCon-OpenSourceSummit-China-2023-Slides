作为中国领先的物流公司，顺丰速运将分享其物流业务的数字化和边缘云转型的完成情况。顺丰速运采用了分层组织结构和云原生技术（如Kubernetes、CNI插件和KubeEdge+EdgeMesh解决方案）来处理大量的用户和货物。通过将数据处理和计算逻辑推入物流节点，并使用KubeEdge集成边缘设备，构建了智能物流系统，实现了全流程自动化，提高了效率和准确性。EdgeMesh的集成连接了云和边缘，并实现了应用数据的实时采集、处理、传输和分析，创建了高效、安全和可靠的边缘网络。边缘解决方案在减少边缘设备的资源使用和复杂性的同时，帮助解决了Kubernetes在边缘场景中的限制和挑战。 
As a leading logistics company in China, SF Express will share how it completed the digital and edge cloud transformation of its logistic business. SF Express used a hierarchical organization structure and cloud-native technologies (such as Kubernetes, CNI plugins, and KubeEdge+EdgeMesh solutions) to handle large volumes of users and goods. By pushing data processing and computing logic into the logistics nodes and integrating edge devices using KubeEdge, an intelligent logistics system was built, achieving full-process automation and improving efficiency and accuracy. The integration of EdgeMesh connects cloud and edge and realizes the real-time collection, processing, transmission, and analysis of application data, creating an efficient, secure, and reliable edge network. While reducing resource usage and complexity of edge devices, the edge solution helps address the limitations and challenges of Kubernetes in edge scenarios.
