成功的开发者平台没有银弹。然而，重要的是要理解主要目标是使开发者能够发挥作用。这与最近发布的CNCF平台白皮书中提到的平台团队的核心工作一致。 然而，对于许多平台团队来说，现实意味着他们很少有机会专注于这些工作。他们的积压工作随着CNCF生态系统的发展速度呈指数增长；他们经常人手不足；他们冒着过于关注技术而忽视最终用户能力的风险。 本次演讲将从产品角度出发，以发现关注最终用户开发者的工作为重点的高级能力的示例为起点。从那里，我们将跨越弧线，通过押注于我们社区已经可用的技术的实际示例，构建高度集成的平台，以用户友好的方式提供这样的价值。 
There is no silver bullet to successful developer platforms. However, it is important to understand that the main goal is to enable developers. This is in line with the core jobs of a platform team mentioned in the recently published CNCF Platforms White Paper. However, reality for many platform teams means they rarely get to focus on those jobs. Their backlogs grow exponentially with the speed of development in the CNCF ecosystem; they are often understaffed; and they risk focusing too much on technologies vs. capabilities for their end-users. This talk will start from the product perspective, giving examples of discovering high-level capabilities that focus on the Jobs-to-be-Done of end-user developers. From there, we span the arc to building highly integrated platforms that deliver such value in a user-friendly way by betting on established or to–be-established standards of our community following practical examples based on technologies already available in our ecosystem.
