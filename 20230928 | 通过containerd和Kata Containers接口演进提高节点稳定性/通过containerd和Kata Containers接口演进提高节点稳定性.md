containerd和Kata Containers，两者都是被命名为容器运行时项目，但实际上它们位于软件堆栈的不同层次。虽然这两个项目已经共同发展了五年多，但容器运行时这个术语常常让很多人感到困惑。 本次演讲将探讨这两个项目的细节，它们的区别以及它们如何共同工作。特别是，我们将详细介绍它们之间的接口演变，从shim-v1到shim-v2，再到正在进行中的sandbox API。我们将解释每个接口变化，并展示为什么引入它，以及它如何导致两个项目的架构变化，从而实现更快的容器运行时，并不时提高节点的稳定性。 最后，我们将展示containerd sandbox API和Kata Containers内置的sandbox功能的最新改进，进一步展示这两个项目如何共同创新，并为容器生态系统带来价值。 
containerd and Kata Containers, both are named container runtime projects but they are actually at different layers of the software stack. While the two projects have been evolving together for more than five years, the term container runtime is often confusing to many. This talk will explore the details of the two projects, what's the difference, and how they work together. Especially, we'll take a look at the interface evolvement between them, from shim-v1 to shim-v2, and to the ongoing sandbox APIs. We'll example each of the interface changes, and show why it was introduced, and how it resulted in architectural changes in both projects, which in turn resulted in faster container runtimes, and enhanced the node stability from time to time. In the end, we'll demonstrate the latest improvements with the containerd sandbox API and Kata Containers' built-in sandbox feature, which further shows how the two projects are innovating together and bringing value to the container ecosystem.
