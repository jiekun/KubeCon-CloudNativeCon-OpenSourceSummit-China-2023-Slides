随着人工智能的发展，软件开发的格局也在不断变化。这一转变为编程带来了新的前沿：生成式人工智能（GAI）。随着我们进入这个新时代，探索和理解伴随这一革命性工具而来的机遇和风险对于开源社区来说至关重要。本次会议旨在揭示将GAI整合到开源开发中的复杂性，深入探讨在开源开发社区中负责任且有效地融入GAI的潜在优势、风险和可能的最佳实践。让我们一起开启一场关于AGI时代下开源软件开发未来的重要对话。在探索如何利用人工智能的力量为开源社区服务的同时，共同应对潜在的陷阱，推动一个公平、创新和包容的未来。 
As AI evolves, so does the landscape of software development. This transformation has opened the door to new frontier in programming: Generative AI (GAI). As we move into this new era, it's impotent to explore and understand both the opportunities and risks that accompany this revolutionary tool, specifically in the context of the open-source community. This session aims to unravel the complexities of integrating GAI into open-source development, providing an in-depth exploration of the potential advantages, risks, and possible best practices for incorporating GAI responsibly and effectively within the open-source development community. Join us as we start a critical conversation on the future of open-source software development in the age of AGI. Together, let's explore how we can harness the power of AI for the open-source community while navigating potential pitfalls to promote a fair, innovative and inclusive future.
